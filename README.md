# RockPaperScissorsProject
This is a project I assigned my students to familiarize them more with python.

Create a rock paper scissors game using python. It must be a player vs computer game, and the computers responses must be random. Utilize the random library in python, and the input() function to get input from the user. When the user inputs their rock, paper, or scissor choice, output the computers response and a message declaring who won.

Rubric:
50% : The code runs without errors
30% : The code runs the game correctly
20% : The code contains comments explaining how it works.
